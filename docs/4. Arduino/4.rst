4.2 Software Download
---------------------

Open the browser and search: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software, we will
take WINDOWS system as an example to show you how to download and
install.

You just need to click JUSTDOWNLOAD,then click the downloaded file to
install it. And when the ZIP file is downloaded,you can directly unzip
and start it.

4.3 Set Arduino IDE
-------------------

Connecting the board to the computer，and select the development board
and port.

Before uploading the program to the board, let’s demonstrate the
function of each symbol in the Arduino IDE toolbar.

1- Used to verify whether there is any compiling mistakes or not.

2- Used to upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

3- Used to send the serial data received from board to the serial
plottle.

4- Used to send the serial data received from board to the serial
monitor.

4.4 Start Your First Program
----------------------------

Open the file to select Example, choose BLINK from BASIC, as shown
below:

|image6|

Set board and COM port, the corresponding board and COM port are shown
on the lower right of IDE.

|image7|

Click\ |image8|\ to start compiling the program, check errors.

|image9|

Click\ |image10|\ to upload the program, upload successfully.

|image11|

Upload the program successfully, the onboard LED lights on for 1s,
lights off for 1s. Congratulation, you have finished the first program.

4.5 Add Library
---------------

Open the Arduino IDE, follow [Sketch] → [Include Library] → [Add .zip
Library]. This method can only import one library file at a time. If the
product has multiple libraries, please import them one by one following
this process!

4.6 Project
-----------

The entire project starts with the basic program. The course will guide
you step by step, from simple to complex, to program a robotic car while
learning about electronics and mechanical concepts. I bet you’re already
eager to give it a try. So, let’s get started!

**Note: (G), marked on each sensor and module, is the negative pole and
connected to “G”, ”-”or “GND”on the sensor shield or control board ; (V)
is the positive pole and linked with V , VCC, + or 5V on the sensor
shield or control board.**

**Experiments should be conducted in line with the wiring diagram,
including the use of right components and the wiring methods. For
example, the supply power applied in the hook-up diagram is external
power , so you will have to use external power rather than USB cable.**
