1- Used to verify whether there is any compiling mistakes or not.

2- Used to upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

3- Used to send the serial data received from board to the serial plottle.

4- Used to send the serial data received from board to the serial monitor.

## 4.4 Start Your First Program

Open the file to select Example, choose BLINK from BASIC, as shown below:

Upload the program successfully, the onboard LED lights on for 1s, lights off for 1s. Congratulation, you have finished the first program.

## 4.5 Add Library

Open the Arduino IDE, follow [Sketch] → [Include Library] → [Add .zip Library]. This method can only import one library file at a time. If the product has multiple libraries, please import them one by one following this process!

## 4.6 Project

The entire project starts with the basic program. The course will guide you step by step, from simple to complex, to program a robotic car while learning about electronics and mechanical concepts. I bet you’re already eager to give it a try. So, let’s get started!

**Note: (G), marked on each sensor and module, is the negative pole and connected to “G”, ”-”or “GND”on the sensor shield or control board ; (V) is the positive pole and linked with V , VCC, + or 5V on the sensor shield or control board.**

**Experiments should be conducted in line with the wiring diagram, including the use of right components and the wiring methods. For example, the supply power applied in the hook-up diagram is external power , so you will have to use external power rather than USB cable.**
